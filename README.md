# Hardcover
#### Adds a few vanilla-adjacent QOL tweaks to the recipe book.

This mod is based on [Better Recipe Book](https://modrinth.com/mod/brb) by marshmallow.

At the time, the author had not ported the mod to 1.19.3. I ported some features to 1.19.3 as "Recipe Book Tweaks". Later on, the author went ahead and ported the mod to 1.19.3+.

With the author's [permission](https://github.com/mrshmllow/BetterRecipeBook/issues/57#issuecomment-1465088492), I continued working on this and rebranded the project as "Hardcover". While the features are almost identical, I have made substantial internal changes, such as using Mixin Extras for better compatibility.
